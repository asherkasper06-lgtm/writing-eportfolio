# ENC 2135 e-Portfolio

This repository contains my electronic writing portfolio for ENC 2135.  
It showcases my composing process, ability to adapt to different rhetorical situations, and what I have learned about genres, sources, and revision.

## Contents

- **Revised Major Project**
  - Located in: `revised-project/`
  - Includes a globally revised version of either Project 1 or Project 2.
  - This version reflects substantial (global) changes to organization, evidence, and rhetorical strategy, plus local sentence-level editing.

- **Artifacts of Composing Practices**
  - Located in: `artifacts/`
  - At least two artifacts that show how I compose and revise, such as:
    - In-class activities
    - Homework assignments
    - Notes or outlines explaining a concept
    - Drafts that show how my writing changed over time
  - Each artifact is paired with a brief description explaining what it shows about my writing process or a specific skill.

- **Reflective Statement**
  - Located in: `reflection/project4-reflection.md`
  - A minimum 500-word reflection that discusses:
    - What I learned about **genres** in this course
    - How I approached **composing** and revising across the three projects
    - The **rhetorical strategies** I used to address different audiences and purposes
    - How my understanding of writing has changed over the semester

## How This Portfolio Meets the Course Outcomes

- **Composing Process**  
  The revised project and artifacts document my writing process from invention and drafting through global revision and editing. Together they show how I used feedback and reflection to improve my work.

- **Adaptability**  
  The major projects and reflection demonstrate how I adapted my writing to different genres, audiences, and contexts (for example, changing tone, format, and evidence depending on purpose).

- **Use of Sources**  
  My revised project and reflection show how I select, synthesize, and integrate source material to support my ideas, rather than just dropping in quotes.

- **Citational Conventions & Mechanics**  
  The revised project uses a consistent citation style and careful attention to grammar, punctuation, and formatting to minimize mechanical errors.
