# ENC 2135 ePortfolio – Asher Kasper

This repository is my electronic writing portfolio for ENC 2135 with Professor Christell Roach.  
It collects one revised major project, two artifacts that show my composing practices, and a final reflection on what I learned about writing in this course.

## Contents

### 1. Revised Major Project

**Project 2: Rhetorical Analysis – "Competing Frames of Truth in the Digital Frontline"**

- File: [`Rhetorical Analysis Reordered (2).pdf`](revised-project/Rhetorical%20Analysis%20Reordered%20(2).pdf)

This is my globally revised version of Project 2.  
It analyzes how Ilan Berman and the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy use ethos, pathos, and logos in their discussions of information warfare in the Middle East. The revision focuses on clearer structure, stronger topic sentences, and tighter connections between claims and evidence.

### 2. Artifacts of Composing Practices

These artifacts show parts of my writing life outside the main projects. They highlight how my interests and experiences connect to my work in this class.

#### Artifact 1: Interest in International Affairs

- File: [`artifact_statement.pdf`](artifacts/artifact_statement.pdf)

This short piece explains how events like the Russian invasion of Ukraine and October 7 shaped my interest in international affairs and diplomacy. It shows how I connect personal background, community, and global politics in reflective writing.

#### Artifact 2: Travel and Global Politics

- File: [`travel_interest_artifact.pdf`](artifacts/travel_interest_artifact.pdf)

This artifact describes how early travel experiences, including sailing in the Virgin Islands and a later trip to Chile during a plebiscite, pushed my curiosity toward global politics and work abroad. It illustrates how I use narrative to link lived experience to academic and career goals.

### 3. Project 4 Reflection

- File: [`project4_reflection_updated.pdf`](reflection/project4_reflection_updated.pdf)

This reflection discusses what I took away from the three major projects in ENC 2135. It focuses on:

- How each project required a different approach to writing  
- What I learned about research and organizing information  
- How rhetorical analysis changed the way I look at arguments  
- How the multigenre campaign made me think about design, clarity, and audience  
- How switching between genres reinforced the idea that writing has to adapt to purpose and context

## How This Portfolio Meets the Course Outcomes

**Composing Process**  
The revised rhetorical analysis and the reflection both show that I moved beyond single drafts and relied on planning, reorganization, and editing to shape my work.

**Adaptability**  
Across the revised project, artifacts, and Project 3 (multigenre campaign), I wrote for different audiences and in different forms, from academic analysis to reflective narrative and visual digital genres.

**Use of Sources**  
The rhetorical analysis demonstrates how I work with sources by summarizing, comparing, and evaluating arguments rather than only quoting them.

**Citational Conventions and Mechanics**  
The revised project and other major assignments use a consistent citation style and careful attention to grammar and formatting.
